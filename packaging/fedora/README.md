# Fedora Packaging

This directory provides a Fedora/COPR baseline for building Luna Launcher as a
COPR-friendly RPM without relying on the in-tree `CPack RPM` path.

For distributable Fedora packages, use Meson's `--prefix=/usr`.
Do not use `/usr/local` for RPM/COPR builds: `/usr/local` is intended for
administrator-managed local software, while packaged files belong under `/usr`.

## What is included

- `lunalauncher.spec`: RPM spec intended for Fedora 42 through Rawhide.
- `make-srpm.sh`: helper to create a source tarball from `HEAD` and build an
  SRPM locally.

## Why use this instead of `CPack`

`CPack` is still useful for local experiments, but COPR works better with a
normal RPM spec because:

- Fedora build dependencies are explicit.
- Scriptlets for desktop, icon, and MIME cache updates are under RPM control.
- Future Fedora-version-specific dependency changes can be made in one place.

## Fedora baseline

The spec currently targets Fedora 42 through Rawhide and sets:

- Meson with `--prefix=/usr` and network fallbacks disabled
- system Qt 6 packages
- standard RPM scriptlets for desktop, icon, and MIME caches

## Build an SRPM locally

Prerequisites:

- `rpm-build`
- `git`

Run:

```bash
./packaging/fedora/make-srpm.sh
```

If you want a local packaging-oriented configure outside `rpmbuild`, run:

```bash
meson setup build --buildtype=release --prefix=/usr --wrap-mode=nodownload
```

Use a separate build directory for normal local development.

The script writes the source tarball and SRPM under `dist/fedora/rpmbuild/`.

## COPR usage

Two straightforward options:

1. Upload the generated SRPM to COPR.
2. Point COPR SCM builds at this repository and use `packaging/fedora/lunalauncher.spec`.

For COPR, use Fedora 42, Fedora 43, Fedora 44, and Rawhide targets.

### Build directly from GitHub in COPR

Yes, but use a COPR `SCM` package pointed at the GitHub repository rather than
the GitHub auto-generated source archive.

Why:

- this project builds with required git submodules under `libraries/`
- GitHub release/source archives do not vendor submodule contents
- the local `make-srpm.sh` workflow already handles creating a complete source
  tarball that includes checked out submodules

The repository now includes `.copr/Makefile` with an `srpm` target for COPR.
That target:

- synchronizes submodule URLs from `.gitmodules`
- initializes submodules with `git submodule update --init --recursive`
- runs `packaging/fedora/make-srpm.sh`
- copies the resulting `*.src.rpm` into COPR's expected output directory

Recommended COPR package settings:

- Source Type: `SCM`
- SCM Type: `git`
- Clone URL: `https://github.com/W-874/LunaLauncher.git`
- Committish: your target branch or tag
- Spec File: `packaging/fedora/lunalauncher.spec`
- SRPM Build Method: `make srpm`

This lets COPR build directly from GitHub without you manually uploading SRPMs.
The remaining requirement is that the referenced submodules are reachable from
the COPR builders.

## Extending later

If dependency or toolchain behavior diverges again between Fedora releases, keep
the spec as the single point of change:

- add `%if 0%{?fedora}` conditionals around dependency differences
- adjust `Launcher_BUILD_PLATFORM` if you want release-specific branding in the
  About dialog
- keep the installed runtime resources under `share/LunaLauncher/resources` so
  Linux packaging stays consistent across targets
